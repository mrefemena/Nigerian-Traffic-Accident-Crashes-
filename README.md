# Nigerian-Traffic-Accident-Crashes-
This dataset offers a detailed examination of road traffic crashes in Nigeria, covering the period from Q4 2020 to Q1 2024. It includes data on the total number of crashes, injuries, fatalities, and vehicles involved
# Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze road accident trends in Nigeria using key metrics such as total crashes, fatalities, injuries, and contributing factors (e.g., speed violations, alcohol use, poor weather, fatigue, and other factors).

# Software
- Tableau
 
# Aim of this analysis
### Assess State-Level Accident Patterns:
Compare accident severity across regions.
Determine which states experience the highest number of crashes, injuries, and fatalities.
### Evaluate the Impact of Crash Contributing Factors:
Assess the role of speed violations, alcohol use, poor weather, and fatigue in road accidents.
Identify the most common causes of crashes.
### Compare Fatalities vs. Injuries:
Analyze the fatality rate vs. injury rate across different states.
Identify states with high fatality rates, which may indicate poor emergency response or severe crash impact.
### Provide Data-Driven Recommendations:
Recommend road safety policies based on accident trends.
Suggest targeted interventions for high-risk areas (e.g., stricter speed enforcement in high-crash zones).
Process
- Imported into Tableau,
- Used Tableau Prep and Data Interpreter to clean and prepare the data,

# Findings:
Abuja has the highest number of road traffic accidents, with 24,260 crashes recorded. This suggests that the capital city experiences the most road accidents, likely due to high vehicle density, urban congestion, and increased road activity. Contributing factors may include speed violations, reckless driving, and poor road infrastructure in certain areas.
Kano, on the other hand, records the highest number of injuries, with 56,320 people injured. Despite having fewer total crashes than Abuja, the severity of accidents in Kano appears to be higher, leading to more death. This could be due to high-impact collisions, densely populated areas, or heavy commercial transport activity. Poor road conditions and limited enforcement of road safety regulations may also play a role.
Sokoto presents a different trend, with 7,430 injuries but 2,075 fatalities, giving it the highest fatality rate of 27.9%. While the total number of crashes is lower compared to Abuja and Kano, the likelihood of death from an accident is significantly higher. This could be due to delayed emergency response, limited access to hospitals, or more severe accidents involving high-speed crashes.
The second largest cause of accidents is speed violation, with Ogun, FCT (Abuja), Kaduna, and Jigawa recording the highest numbers in that order.
This indicates that over-speeding is a major contributor to road crashes in these states. Speed violations increase the severity of accidents, leading to more injuries and fatalities due to reduced reaction time and higher impact during collisions.






# Recommendations:
Enhance emergency response systems and medical services to effectively manage the high rate of injuries.
Implement stronger accident prevention measures, improve trauma care, and enforce stricter traffic laws to minimize fatalities.
Strengthen speed limit enforcement by deploying speed cameras and imposing tougher penalties for violations.
Install additional road signs and speed bumps in high-risk areas to promote safer driving.
Launch public awareness campaigns to educate drivers on the dangers of excessive speeding.
Upgrade road infrastructure to discourage reckless overtaking and hazardous driving behavior.
